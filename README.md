Various evolutionary algorithms

## ka/ks ratio

ka.ks.R will (eventually) work out ka/ks ratio for a set of aligned genes (will do the alignment as well).

## seqeunce entropy and information density calculator
 
How much time does a low density information carrier take to evolve - what is the minimum density for evolution of complexity
Entropy of seqeuences under selection and order due to drift.
